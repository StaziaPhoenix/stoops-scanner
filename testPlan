1)	Test new calibration method using testCalibrate folder. 

	Manually choose threshold based on first 3 readings and see how
	calibrate's output compares. Move to step 2 after calibration is 
	reliable.
-----------------------
2)	Make sure calibrate is correctly integrated into large file. 

	Run Main.ino with calibrate integrated (already exists). Print
	digital following every read/filter and wiggle laterally to check line		viewage based on calibrate's output.
-----------------------
3)	Continue battling light problem of April 1.

	First check performance in bright room with no self-lighting. If
	results good, be assured and continue development assuming good lighting
	with parallel development of lighting. If bright room results not good,
	identify non-lighting problem and pursue as greater importance.

	Try increasing exposure time substanially, with no self-lighting. View
	raw pixel output and calibrate's digital line. Possible performance
	increase in dim lighting with dynamic exposure setting if manual
	changes in exposure yield positive result.

	If determine that self-lighting is necessary, build the epic contraption
	of ages. I will draw it now, essentially create an artificial ceiling to
	provide consistent overhead brightness.

	Return if none of above work.
------------------------
4)	Edge cases. Incorporate behavior for intersections and jolts.
